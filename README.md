### INTRODUCTION.  
The infamous "Aw Snap! Something went wrong" error you get with Google Chrome and you have Symantec Endpoint Protection installed.  
This simple registry patch will fix the error.  In the past I have changed the name of Chrome.exe to something like Chrome_.exe or even _Chrome.exe and that would fix it.
I got tired of doing this so I wrote a simple registry patch.

Have fun!
